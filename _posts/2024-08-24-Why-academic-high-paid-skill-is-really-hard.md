## Academic Program as a Main Idea for a Main Work

George Hotz often tells people not to ask stupid questions. But if I met him personally, I wouldn’t hesitate to ask him this one:

> **"Is it possible to compound your academic interests into real-world success?"**

I imagine his answer would be something like,
> *"Bro, if it’s cool, it’s possible for sure."*

I have an idea for a program where the main beneficiaries would be large corporations and a small segment of academia. I’m really passionate about it, yet the notion that I’m reinventing the wheel weighs heavily on me.

The key concept behind the program is to simulate materials and define their properties based on *in vivo* simulations rather than strictly relying on empirical data. It involves parallel treatments of photons, electrons, phonons, and molecules as energy carriers, aiming for a fundamental understanding and the development of descriptive tools for energy and heat transport processes from the nanoscale to the macroscale. This work could find applications in various nano- and micro-technologies in hardware.

It’s not a groundbreaking idea that will revolutionize the world, but it is a well-researched area suitable for exploration by PhD candidates. However, as an undergrad without experience in competitive environments or high-expectation societies, I doubt I’ll get the guidance or support I need from the community.

Some key questions arise:

- **Is it possible to develop this idea or uncover latent potential by pursuing it?**
- **Is academic usefulness still valuable in a market saturated with huge investments and highly skilled researchers from past and present?**

I try to stay engaged with the community, read journals, and keep up with what people are working on—but it all still feels very vague. I keep hearing about “high-income skills” and the buzz around today’s culture, yet creating something truly unique is no easy task.

I’ve let go of the myth of the “genius programmer/hacker” in favor of a team-based approach, but I haven’t found anyone interested in the same topics. The initial idea might be born in one person’s mind, but the journey to a final product requires the collaboration of many talented people.

## Side Hustle in the Academia

It’s often said that the path to a comfortable life is straightforward: do your best now, and compound growth will take care of the rest in the future. Of course, this overlooks the events beyond your control.

But how can you achieve compound growth when many in academia remain stuck in highly specialized research? I’m not saying that their work isn’t necessary—but it doesn’t usually lead to the “Pinterest-worthy” life that most people aspire to.

## Investing Anecdote and the Diversification of Skills

So, in the context of economic advice, think of your time as a form of capital that you want to invest wisely.

> **Key Investing Principles:**
>
> - **Diversify:** Don’t put all your eggs in one basket.
> - **Invest with a long time horizon:** Patience is key.
> - **Minimize churn and transaction costs:** Avoid unnecessary burn-out.
> - **Know your risk profile and liquidity needs:** Understand what you’re willing to lose and what you need access to.

For a 20-year-old in academia, **diversifying** might mean engaging in hobbies or side jobs in your leisure time, or even pursuing a second degree—which often feels like a trap.

Investing with a long time horizon, to me, means following the curriculum for your degree, trying to secure a job after graduation, and enduring the grind of your studies.

In economic terms, this concept emphasizes the importance of maintaining a long-term perspective when investing your resources—be it time, energy, or money.

Minimizing churn or transaction costs in this context could be understood as **not burning out from your major** commitments.

Understanding your risk profile is crucial: you need to decide now what you want to focus on for the next few years.

## Current Culture of Creating, Not Consuming

Simulating materials might help determine the exact parameters needed to make hardware less prone to overheating in a changing climate, for example. However, this task feels vague and abstract. It’s a long-term goal, much like developing autonomous cars—you never know if you’ll ever succeed.

So, what determines the value of my work hours? Coding something outdated doesn’t contribute meaningfully to the world, nor does it provide a comfortable life.

## Geohotz as an Example of Diversification of Interests

George "geohotz" Hotz is a compelling example of how knowledge, when paired with experience, can lead to remarkable outcomes. I’m not particularly drawn to his social media presence, but when he delves into programming or shares insights during livestreams, his work is consistently impressive, often interesting, and sometimes even beneficial to the broader community.

I still adhere to the principle: **if you're not cool, don't talk to me.** Launching a startup that burns through funding isn’t cool, but taking the right actions in challenging circumstances? That’s cool.

## Final Thoughts

Academic high-paid skills are really hard because they require the compounding of deep, specialized knowledge with real-world application—something that demands not only individual brilliance but also collaboration and diverse interests. The journey from a groundbreaking academic idea to tangible, high-impact success is filled with challenges:

- **Navigating the academic system** and its expectations.
- **Finding a community** that shares and supports your ideas.
- **Diversifying your skills** to not only specialize but also innovate.
- **Managing your time and resources** in a culture that increasingly values creation over mere consumption.

The struggle is real—but so is the potential reward when knowledge meets experience, and when a well-rounded team pushes forward a well-researched idea into the real world.
